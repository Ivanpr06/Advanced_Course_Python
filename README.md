  <p>In this course, you can find some information about the CS50 course from Harvard, translated by Edutin Academy. They provide us with a wide variety of information about <b>Python</b>, such as object-       oriented programming, some useful libraries and how to create one ourselves, regular expressions, the basics of unit testing, the use of CSV files, and how to use them, among other things.</p>

    <p>In this course, you can find information about a MoureDev course by Brais Moure that anyone can watch on YouTube. He teaches us a large amount of useful information about Python, such as handling         dates, list comprehension, lambdas, higher-order functions, displaying all types of errors in our Python code, file handling, regular expressions, and package management. Moreover, all this theory is        accompanied by a ton of exercises on <a href="https://retosdeprogramacion.com/ejercicios/">Brais's website</a>, which are very useful.</p>

    <p>In this folder, you can find two Python courses focused on Data Analysis. The first one covers all the essential knowledge for analyzing data. I learned about Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and       other interesting topics such as reading CSV files, managing DataFrames, and more. This course opened up a whole new world for me, sparking a deep interest in the field. The second course was my first       introduction to data analysis, where I learned the basics.</p>
