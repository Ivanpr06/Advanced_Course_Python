  <p>In this course, you can find some information about the CS50 course from Harvard, translated by Edutin Academy. They provide us with a wide variety of information about <b>Python</b>, such as object-oriented programming, some useful libraries and how to create one ourselves, regular expressions, the basics of unit testing, the use of CSV files, and how to use them, among other things.</p>
